# Description
Our website utilizes the users location to: 
Find the current weather
Then display 5 playlists to compliment the ‘mood’
We also offers options to see the weather in other locations
Our initial thoughts for development were more oriented towards music. We then decided to utilize the Spotify API and a weather API.

User Story: As an indecisive person, I want to generate a playlist based on the weather of my location, or based other interesting locations so that I can have music that fits the atmosphere of a place.
